                                The following is a list of characteristics for an individual with a True Color of 'green'. I have included the phrases that I most relate with.
                                <br>
                                "Others often describe you as extremely intelligent. You have an innate desire to do things to the best of your ability, and take pride in your work. Even on the weekends, you canâ€™t stand the thought of wasting a day by doing nothing, and always try to fit as much into each day as possible. You are also a big thinker. You enjoy talking with others about abstract, philosophical ideas. You enjoy thinking about the future and all of its possibilities. You believe that you should never stop learning, and enjoy learning new information simply for your own enjoyment. Individuals with green personalities do well in careers that allow them to apply all of the 'big ideas' they have. They typically succeed in careers within higher education, science, technology development, and medicine."

                                Over the course of high school, I have developed a passion for computers and chemistry. I intend to major on the spectrum between Electrical Engineering and Computer Science.

                            <h4><i>Hobbies & More</i></h4>
                            <p class="main_text indent">
                                In my free time, I watch a LOT of educational videos/lectures about STEM, as well as history, psychology, philosophy, and more! Whenever a good idea pops in my head, I'll do a little programming with Python. I take part in a weekly game of Dungeons & Dragons in order to de-stress and break out of my comfort zone through roleplay. Like many others my age, I play video games too, but I do it for more than just entertainment. I enjoy analyzing their components to find real-world parallels, getting lost in a good story that makes me think, and using them as a catalyst for developing my interests/identity.

                                I've long thought about getting into blacksmithing, but I've not yet been able to take a class for it. Breadboards are also something that pique my interest, as circutry fascinates me, especially in such a tangible format. I have selected Guitar as one of my senior electives, and am enjoying the progress I have made so far. Hopefully this trend continues and I keep playing for years to come.
